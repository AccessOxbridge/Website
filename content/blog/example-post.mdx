## Understanding Oxford's Admissions Requirements

Before you begin your application, it's crucial to understand what Oxford looks for in candidates. The university seeks students who demonstrate:

> "Oxford admissions is not just about grades—it's about finding students who will thrive in our unique tutorial system and contribute to our academic community." — Oxford Admissions Officer

## Academic Preparation

### A-Level and Equivalent Qualifications

For most courses, Oxford requires three A-levels (or equivalent) with grades of A*AA or higher. Some competitive courses like Medicine require A*A*A. Key points to remember:

1. **Predicted Grades**: Your teachers' predictions carry significant weight
2. **Subject Relevance**: Choose subjects that demonstrate your interest in the course
3. **Extended Project**: EPQs can provide additional evidence of research skills

### International Qualifications

If you're applying from outside the UK, ensure your qualifications meet Oxford's equivalency requirements:

- **IB**: 38-40 points with 6s and 7s in Higher Level subjects
- **US High School**: Strong SAT/ACT scores plus AP/IB courses
- **Other Systems**: Check the specific requirements for your country

## The UCAS Application Process

### Personal Statement Strategy

Your personal statement is your opportunity to showcase your passion and suitability for the course. Oxford admissions tutors look for:

- **Specific Examples**: Concrete evidence of your interest
- **Critical Analysis**: How you've engaged with your subject beyond the curriculum
